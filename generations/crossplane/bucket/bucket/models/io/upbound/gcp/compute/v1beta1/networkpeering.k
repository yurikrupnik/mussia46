    Attributes
    ----------
    exportCustomRoutes : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether to export the custom routes to the peer network. Defaults to false.
    exportSubnetRoutesWithPublicIp : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether subnet routes with public IP range are exported. The default value is true, all subnet routes are exported. The IPv4 special-use ranges (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Special_addresses) are always exported to peers and are not controlled by this field.
    id : str, default is Undefined, optional
        an identifier for the resource with format {{network}}/{{name}}
    importCustomRoutes : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether to import the custom routes from the peer network. Defaults to false.
    importSubnetRoutesWithPublicIp : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether subnet routes with public IP range are imported. The default value is false. The IPv4 special-use ranges (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Special_addresses) are always imported from peers and are not controlled by this field.
    network : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The primary network of the peering.
    peerNetwork : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The peer network in the peering. The peer network
        may belong to a different project.
    stackType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Which IP version(s) of traffic and routes are allowed to be imported or exported between peer networks. The default value is IPV4_ONLY. Possible values: ["IPV4_ONLY", "IPV4_IPV6"].
    state : str, default is Undefined, optional
        State for the peering, either ACTIVE or INACTIVE. The peering is
        ACTIVE when there's a matching configuration in the peer network.
    stateDetails : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Details about the current state of the peering.

    A Condition that may apply to a resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        LastTransitionTime is the last time this condition transitioned from one
        status to another.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A Message containing details about this condition's last transition from
        one status to another, if any.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        A Reason for this condition's last transition from one status to another.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        Status of this condition; is it currently True, False, or Unknown?
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        Type of this condition. At most one of each condition type may apply to
        a resource at any point in time.
