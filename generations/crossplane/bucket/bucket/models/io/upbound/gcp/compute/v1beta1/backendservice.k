        For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is
        UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S))
        and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).
        See the Backend Services Overview

    capacityScaler : float, default is Undefined, optional
        A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
        (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
        Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%
        of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A
        setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering

        the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
        are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
        For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
        endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
        located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
        Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
        Network Endpoint Group backends.

    maxConnectionsPerEndpoint : float, default is Undefined, optional

        maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
    maxConnectionsPerInstance : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max number of simultaneous connections that a single

        The max requests per second (RPS) of the group.
        Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,

    InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

    in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
    The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
    avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
    required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
    for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an

        and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).
        See the Backend Services Overview

        A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
