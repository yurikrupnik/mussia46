        From version 6.0.0 default value will be UTILIZATION to match default GCP value.

        Possible values are: UTILIZATION, RATE, CONNECTION.

        A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering

        Provide this property when you create the resource.
    failover : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More

    group : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
        of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
        instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
        the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
        are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
        For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
        endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
        located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
        Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
        Network Endpoint Group backends.
        When the load_balancing_scheme is INTERNAL, only instance groups
        are supported.

        Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a

    maxConnectionsPerEndpoint : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
        network endpoint can handle. Cannot be set

        This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
        used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For
        CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
    maxConnectionsPerInstance : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
        backend instance can handle. Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend
        services.
        This is used to calculate the capacity of the group.
        Can be used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
        For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
    maxRate : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
        Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
        but required if RATE mode. Either maxRate or one
        of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
        group type, must be set.
    maxRatePerEndpoint : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
        endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of

        Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
        See the Backend Services Overview
        for an explanation of load balancing modes.
        From version 6.0.0 default value will be UTILIZATION to match default GCP value.
        Default value is CONNECTION.
        Possible values are: UTILIZATION, RATE, CONNECTION.
    capacityScaler : float, default is Undefined, optional
        A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
        (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
        ~>NOTE: This field cannot be set for
        INTERNAL region backend services (default loadBalancingScheme),
        but is required for non-INTERNAL backend service. The total
        capacity_scaler for all backends must be non-zero.
        A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
        0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional description of this resource.
        Provide this property when you create the resource.
    failover : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
        than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
    group : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
        of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
        instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
        the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
        are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
        For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
        endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
        located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
        Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
        Network Endpoint Group backends.
        When the load_balancing_scheme is INTERNAL, only instance groups
        are supported.
        Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
        partial URL.
    groupRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta2RegionBackendServiceSpecInitProviderBackendItems0GroupRef, default is Undefined, optional
        group ref
    groupSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta2RegionBackendServiceSpecInitProviderBackendItems0GroupSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        group selector
    maxConnections : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max number of simultaneous connections for the group. Can
        be used with either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
        Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend services.
        For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or one
        of maxConnectionsPerInstance or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint,
        as appropriate for group type, must be set.
    maxConnectionsPerEndpoint : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
        network endpoint can handle. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
        This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
        used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For
        CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
    maxConnectionsPerInstance : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
        backend instance can handle. Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend
        services.
        This is used to calculate the capacity of the group.
        Can be used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
        For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
    maxRate : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
        Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
        but required if RATE mode. Either maxRate or one
        of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
        group type, must be set.
    maxRatePerEndpoint : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
        endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
        the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
        either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
    maxRatePerInstance : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
        instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
        the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
        either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
    maxUtilization : float, default is Undefined, optional
        Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
        CPU utilization target for the group. Valid range is [0.0, 1.0].
        Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend services.
