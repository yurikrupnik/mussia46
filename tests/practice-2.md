Array & String Manipulation:
1.	Rotate an Array: Given an array and a number k, rotate the array to the right by k steps without using extra space.
2.	Find Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers from 0 to n, find the missing number in O(n) time.
3.	Anagram Check: Write a function to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.
4.	First Non-Repeating Character: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character and return its index.

Sorting & Searching:
5.	Quick Sort Implementation: Implement Quick Sort and explain its worst-case time complexity.
6.	Find Kth Largest Element: Given an unsorted array, find the Kth largest element efficiently.

Graph & Tree Algorithms:
7.	Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree: Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a BST.
8.	Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS): Implement DFS and BFS for traversing a graph.

Dynamic Programming & Backtracking:
9.	Subset Sum Problem: Given an array of numbers and a target sum, determine if a subset exists that sums up to the target.
10.	Word Break Problem: Given a string and a dictionary of words, determine if the string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.
